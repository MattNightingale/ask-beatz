## 📝 Overview

This project was built from a partially completed codebase and expanded to include full functionality for both the Ask and Shop pages, as well as filling in the previously empty Home and About pages.  
The **Ask** page uses AI integration to suggest songs based on moods, vibes and feelings, with pre-filled prompt options for ease of use.  
The **Shop** page includes product listings with sorting and page size controls, allowing users to browse dynamically loaded items with "show more" functionality.
The **Home** and **About** pages have text and image content, with buttons to navigate through the site and tabs to look at paged content.
